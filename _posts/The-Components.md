* **$state** / **$stateProvider**: Manages state definitions, the current state, and state transitions. This includes triggering transition-related events and callbacks, asynchronously resolving any dependencies of the target state, and updating $location to reflect the current state. For states that have URLs, a rule is automatically registered with $urlRouterProvider that performs a transition to that state.
* **ui-sref** directive: Equivalent to href or ng-href in `<a />` elements except the target value is a state name. Adds an appropriate href to the element according to the state associated URL.
* **ui-view** directive: Renders views defined in the current state. Essentially ui-view directives are (optionally named) placeholders that gets filled with views defined in the current state. 
* **$urlRouter** / **$urlRouterProvider**: Manages a list of _rules_ that are matched against $location whenever it changes. At the lowest level, a rule can be an arbitrary function that inspects $location and returns true if it was handled. Support is provided on top of this for RegExp rules and URL patterns that are compiled into UrlMatcher objects via $urlMatcherFactory.
* **$urlMatcherFactory**: Compiles URL patterns with placeholders into UrlMatcher objects. In addition to the placeholder syntax supported by $routeProvider, it also supports an extended syntax that allows a regexp to be specified for the placeholder, and has the ability to extract named parameters from the query part of the URL.
* **$templateFactory**: Loads templates via $http / $templateCache. Used by $state.
